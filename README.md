With a background in healthcare administration and self taught predictive analytics, I am at an exciting time in my career where I am transitioning from healthcare administration to the field of data science. I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science at Syracuse University, with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP). My expected graduation date is December 2024.
